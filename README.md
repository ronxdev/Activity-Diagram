So, the requirement is to develop a fully automated robot/ “system” that will inspect any item on the production line and communicate the quality results to a ‘node’ that is part of the PCS. The process is as follows: FANUC will pick up an item, reads the universal product code (UPC) and convey this information to the PCS for validation purposes. If validated, the system will respond and inform FANUC to proceed. Otherwise it will inform FANUC to place it on the rejection conveyer belt. If validated, FANUC will then inspect the item and calculate a status check. After this check, it will send the state information to the system. The system will update the database with the new information. It will place the item back on the production line, picks up the next item, just to repeat the above procedure. At the end of the day, it will send a production report to the system. The system will on its turn, send a copy to production management.https://github.com/ronxdev/Activity-Diagram/blob/ca8f904464c037a4b9eea82d951e69f5358f7356/Activity%20Diagram.JPG
